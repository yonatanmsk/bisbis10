# Restaurant Management System

## Overview
The bisbis10 restaurant management system is a backend service designed to handle various operations related to restaurants, their dishes, and ratings. The system aims to provide a comprehensive platform for managing restaurant data, including details about the restaurants, their cuisines, dishes, and customer ratings.

## Functionality
The system provides the following APIs:

- **Restaurants API**: Manages restaurant data.
- **Ratings API**: Manages customer ratings for restaurants.
- **Dishes API**: Manages the dishes offered by each restaurant.

## Technical Aspects
The system is built using Java Spring Boot, leveraging its robust framework for creating RESTful APIs. Data persistence can be managed using an in-memory database like H2 for simplicity, or a more robust solution like PostgreSQL for production.

## Homework Task
Candidates are expected to design and implement the above APIs, adhering to RESTful principles.
